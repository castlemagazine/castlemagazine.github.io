      <P><h1>Castle is a modern magazine for people who treasure games and appreciate print.</h1></P><P><h2>We want to underscore the importance of video games in our cultural landscape through themed issues that explore the worlds they inhabit and affect.</P><P>Castle is a diverse magazine that sits outside the core games sphere, and will present games and ideas to readers less familiar with the industry. That means no jargon and no current trends. We’re not interested in reviews and make no effort to cover new games. We’re interested in essays, interviews, illustration, profiles, fiction, and photojournalism of varying lengths.</h2></P>

      <P><h1>Our first issue will explore the intersection between video games and health.</h1></P><P><h2>We want to chart the changing purpose of health as a game mechanic, and go beyond games to explore how they affect our minds and bodies.</P><P>We’re investigating the relationship between health technology and games. We’re exploring addiction as a game mechanic as well as addiction to games themselves. We’re looking at how our health can be affected by digital experiences and how games are used in treatment and training.</h2></P>
