      <P><h2>WHAT IS CASTLE?</h2></P>
      <P><h1>Castle is a modern magazine about video games.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>We want to underscore the importance of gaming in our cultural landscape through themed issues that investigate the worlds they inhabit and affect.</h1></P>
      <P><h2>WHAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE ABOUT?</h2></P>
      <P><h1>Our first issue will explore the intersection between video games and health. We want to chart the changing purpose of health as a game mechanic, and go beyond games to explore how they affect our minds and bodies.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>Weâ€™re open for submissions. If you'd like to know more, take a look at <a href="assets/Castle_editorial_deck_Issue01.pdf" download>our editorial deck</a>, and <a href="mailto:hello@castlemagazine.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</h1></P>
      <P><h2>I WANT TO KNOW MORE</h2></P>
      <P><h1>We'll be crowdfunding our first issue in Q1 2016. In the meantime, you can follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/castle_magazine">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/castle_magazine">Instagram</a>. </h1></P>
