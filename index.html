      <P><h1>Castle is a modern magazine about video games, and the worlds they inhabit and affect.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>We want to underscore the importance of video games in our cultural landscape through themed issues that explore the worlds they inhabit and affect.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>Our first issue will explore the intersection between video games and health.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>We want to chart the changing purpose of health as a game mechanic, and go beyond games to explore how they affect our minds and bodies.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>Weâ€™re open for submissions. If you'd like to know more, take a look at <a href="assets/Castle_editorial_deck_Issue01.pdf" download>our editorial deck</a>.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>We are currently working on our first issue, which we will be crowdfunding in Q1 2016.</h1></P>
      <P><h1>In the meantime, you can follow us on Twitter and Instagram.</h1></P>
