      <P>Our first issue will explore the intersection between video games and health.</P><P>Health is intrinsic to games. It’s been there from the start. We want to chart the changing purpose of health as a game mechanic, and go beyond games to explore how they affect our minds and bodies.</P><P>We’re investigating the relationship between health technology and games. We’re exploring addiction as a game mechanic as well as addiction to games themselves.
